# 🛣️ Highway Network Analysis for Supply Chain Optimization

This module is a subproject under the broader effort of analyzing India's road network to optimize supply chain distribution. This folder focuses on **highway-level** analysis to determine the role of major roads in improving logistics efficiency.

## 🚀 Objective

To identify critical highway segments whose optimization (e.g., edge addition, route enhancement) would lead to a significant reduction in overall transportation inefficiency. The project uses **network science** techniques to analyze structural properties of the national highway graph.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🗺️ **Highway Graph Construction**: Converts filtered highway data into a graph-based format.
- 📊 **Centrality Measures**: Identifies bottlenecks using stress and betweenness centralities.
- ➕ **Edge Addition Analysis**: Suggests highway links that can improve network flow.
- ⛓️ **Comparative Study**: Compares results between previous and final approaches.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Navigate to the `final/` directory for the latest working pipeline.
2. Run centrality or optimization scripts as described in the main project README.
3. Use visualizations or logs to interpret the suggested network enhancements.
